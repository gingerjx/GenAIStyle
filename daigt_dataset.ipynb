lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted.', 'The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.', 'Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process.', 'In his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate.', 'The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president.', 'The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism.', 'Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters.', \"People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen.\", 'The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions.', 'People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes.', 'The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day.', 'In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.', 'Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems.', 'The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College.', 'Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before.', 'According to Bradford Plumer in his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party.', 'Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please.', 'Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now.', 'The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about.', 'In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President.', 'The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.', 'In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents.', 'The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications.', 'For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.'],

       " TextChunk(sentences=['Ever since cars were invented, they have widely been used as the primary source of transportation.', 'They became so commonplace that their widespread use started to introduce negative impacts.', 'As a result, some countries, or cities, have recently put in place programs or events to limit, or decrease, the amount of car usage in that area.', 'There are many advantages to limiting car usage, including that not using cars is better for the environment and that it allows the city to improve itself.', 'In recent years, the environment has become a worldwide concern one of the advantages to limiting car usage is that it will positively impact the environment.', 'Today, people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience.', 'One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.', 'In Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s essay \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", she writes, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States\".', 'By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially.', 'While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable.', \"The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world.\", 'Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\".', 'According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days.', 'The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe.', 'The plan for the ban had been that cars with evennumbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with oddnumbered license plates not to be used the next day.', 'In actuality, cars with oddnumbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day.', 'This shows the impact of limiting car usage.', 'In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day.', 'If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant.', 'This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one.', 'Additionally, the limited use of cars opens many opportunities for cities to improve themselves by adding new features or improving upon old ones.', 'In the article \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed.', \"The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year.\", 'It reads, \"It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city\\'s mayor.', 'Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the cityuneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\".', \"These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport.\", 'Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means.', 'Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely.', 'Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay \"In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars\".', 'She writes, \"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs\".', 'One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway.', 'Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores.', 'This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending.', 'The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself.', 'There are many advantages to limiting car use.', 'Not only does it improve the environment by removing smog and reducing greenhouse gas emission, but it also allows the area to improve itself by building new features.', 'For this reason, limited car

some even able to be digitally present in the classroom through video conferencing.', 'However, this form of learning is not beneficial to students as it can reduce social skills and interaction, result in communication errors, and cause students to be distracted while learning from their home.', 'One of the main reasons attending classes from home is not a good form of learning is because it causes students to miss out on social interaction.', 'The widespread use of technology can cause people to spend less time talking in person to someone and more time hiding behind a digital persona.',

student does not have the opportunity to communicate directly with a teacher figure, learning how to express concerns, and form bonds with people that are higher up than them.', 'Without this social

teacher can only describe to the student how to set it up, rather than actually showing them how to solve the issue in person.', 'Therefore, video chatting is subject to miscommunication between

by taking online classes, people are less equipped in dealing with face-to-face interactions in the real world when the time comes.', 'However, these people also fail to consider that there are flaws in brick and mortar schools which can burden those who prefer an option of taking classes online instead.', 'Although some may believe otherwise, it would heavily benefit students to be able to attend classes at home because there are some people who prefer not being in a physical classroom, there are less cases of missing class from emergencies, and there are more flexibilities given to students.', 'One reason why students would benefit to attend classes from home is if they have limited social skills and they are not comfortable with vocally situating themselves in a physical classroom.', 'A personal situation which displays this is my cousin Generic_Name, who decided to take online classes starting his first year of middle school due to his severe anxiety since 4th grade which made it hard for him to interact with other students since he was younger.', 'His anxiety also impacted him since it became more difficult with concentrating and asking for guidance from
